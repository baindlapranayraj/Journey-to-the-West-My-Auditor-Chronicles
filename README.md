#  Journey to the west: üïäÔ∏è My Auditor Chronicles

Do you believe in freedom? <br/>

Or should I ask, are you living your life with the fullest of your freedom? Well, for some people freedom is buying things, like it could be a fancy car, expensive Rolex, or for some others, going for parties and bars and enjoying their youthful life. Everyone has their own level of freedom they have either **achieved** or **given** in their life.

I am not a philosophical guy to talk about what freedom is, I am just a 20-year-old nobody guy. For me personally, freedom is eating good food from a fancy restaurant, buying a PS5 and playing some video games, buying the clothes that I want to wear, going and traveling outside like a bird wherever I want to go, and giving my parents the best of their life.

But I don't have this **freedom**.

You either like it or not, the root cause to achieve all these freedoms is **money**. I might be wrong but this is what I see around me. Some folks around my age are able to enjoy their life going on trips, going for parties or clubs. Now I am not saying going for parties is a wrong thing, it's just they got the freedom to do so, which was **given** from their parents and I am happy for them. The thing is I don't have that freedom to do such things. Well, my dad is one of the most hardworking people I have ever known, he is ready to sacrifice anything to give me good education. But still there are some **boundaries** that I cannot ask for. 

To remove these **boundaries**, I should **earn** my own freedom. That's why I have started acquiring some skills to get some income. On Aug 1st 2023, I have started learning some programming (web dev). Soon after learning some tech stack, I have seen about Solana which is a blockchain where we can build smart contracts. I got interested and started learning about it and built a couple of contracts. Parallelly I am seeing on Twitter some folks are doing something called **auditing**. When I first heard of it, I had no clue what it was.

I dug deep little by little every day while parallelly building some contracts. I was fascinated by it. I mean, the amount we earn is good but the freedom we get alongside earning is unimaginably incredible. I might be wrong, but I believe auditing is one of the best careers we can have.


So on Aug 1st 2025, I am going all in into auditing. I don't know when I will achieve my **freedom**, but I will keep pushing forward until I get it. I wanted to keep track of my learnings. I have seen some people doing 1001 days of auditing which was suggested by @_hrkrshnn. Now I don't want to do stuff like that because I have already done it in my dev journey, sharing every day what I have learned. The thing I have noticed is that there will always be something to share in dev like I would always be writing some code/project and I can easily share my code and tell what I am doing, but in auditing, it's mostly about reading and understanding the code itself. So I have decided to write a blog every month about what I have learned so far. It would be efficient to track my journey and share my journey with others I will share any resources which I found intresting.

The only thing I want to keep myself remembering is **Shinzou wo Sasageyo**. üïäÔ∏è
